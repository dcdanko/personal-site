My research comprises microbial studies of the built environment, studies of how microbiomes have changed since the start of the industrial revolution, and developing molecular models of health to better identify disease. I'm always interested in working with new people so feel free to get in touch.\n\n\n# Currently\n\nRight now I split my time between working to develop microbial identification tests for Biotia and a Post-Doc in the Chris Mason Lab. My primary research interests right now are understanding how the immune system reacts to specific microbes and how wastewater sampling can be used to measure the health of urban populations.\n\n",renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
