# Intro

I am a computational biologist using DNA sequencing to understand how environmental microbes affect human health. My research comprises microbial studies of the built environment, studies of how microbiomes have changed since the start of the industrial revolution, and developing molecular models of health to better identify disease. I'm always interested in working with new people so feel free to get in touch.


# Currently

Now, I work as the Director of Software Engineering and Bioinformatics at [Biotia](https://biotia.io/) where my team and I use machine learning to build clinical grade diagnostic tests based on sequencing.
